/**
 * Implementation of algorithm for water amount calculation on a surface with
 * vessel method.
 *
 * <p>Consider areas with a water as two-dimensional vessels with a curved
 * bottom which have left and right walls. Left and right walls can be
 * different heights. Curved bottom can't be higher than the smallest wall of
 * the vessel. The problem is to find the left and right walls of all vessels
 * and then sum their volumes.
 *
 * <p>Algorithm description:
 *
 * <p>1. Run over the surface from left to right.
 *
 * <p>2. Check in a loop:
 * <p>- If the point of the surface is above the following then it's the left
 * wall of the vessel. Record it as *left* and exit the loop.
 * <p>- Otherwise, we pass to the next point to the right and continue the cycle.
 *
 * <p>As soon as we found the left wall, we look for the right one. To do this,
 * we jump over the one point after the *left* (because the water can't
 * accumulate between two adjacent points) and run farther to the right.
 *
 * <p>3. Check in a loop:
 * <p>- If the point is higher than the previous then it is probably the right
 * wall of the vessel (but still not a fact!) - Record it as *right* and exit
 * the loop.
 * <p>- Otherwise, we pass to the next point to the right and continue the
 * cycle.
 *
 * <p>4. Now we need to make sure that *right* is really the right wall of the
 * vessel. To do this, we check in a second loop (we continue to run over the
 * surface from *(right + 1)*):
 * <p>If the point is higher than the *right*, then check:
 * <p>a) if the *right* and current point are both higher than the *left*, it
 * means that we found the right wall of the vessel (which is equal to
 * *right*), exit the loop;
 * <p>b) otherwise, assign *right* to this point and continue the cycle.
 *
 * <p>As soon as we found the left and right walls of the vessel, we can
 * calculate the water in it. The water level in the vessel equals the height
 * of the smallest wall. Hence we can calculate the amount of water above
 * each surface point.
 *
 * <p>Then continue to move further along the surface starting with the *
 * (right +
 * 1)* and look for the next vessel walls on the same algorithm.
 *
 * <p>The complexity of the algorithm depends on the curvature of the surface.
 * <p>The upper bound of the complexity of the algorithm equals Î©(N + (N - 2) + (N - 4) + ... + (N - N))
 * <p>The lower bound of the complexity of the algorithm equals O(N).
